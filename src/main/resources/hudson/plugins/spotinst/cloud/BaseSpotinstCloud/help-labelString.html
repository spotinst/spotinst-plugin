<div>
    Labels are used for grouping all agents from Elastigroup into one logical group in Jenkins. <br>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Use spaces between each label.</div>
    For instance 'dev batchService' will assign a node the labels 'dev' and 'batchService'.<br>
    For example, if you have multiple jobs that builds/tests a certain service, you can configure the label of specific
    Elastigroup to be the service name e.g 'batchService-1', then tie the relevant jobs to the 'batchService-1' label.<br>
    This allows your service jobs to run on any of that specific Elastigroup slaves but not on anywhere else.
